# Introduction

This repository contains Python programs that demonstrate asynchronous functions and concepts. Asynchronous programming is essential for building efficient and responsive applications that can perform tasks concurrently without blocking other operations. Explore the programs to learn more about how Python handles asynchronous operations.

# Program Listings

- **0-basic_async_syntax.py:** This program provides a basic example of Python's asynchronous syntax using `async` and `await`.

- **1-concurrent_coroutines.py:** Demonstrates concurrent execution of coroutines using asyncio.

- **2-measure_runtime.py:** Measures the execution time of asynchronous functions.

- **3-tasks.py:** Illustrates the usage of asyncio Tasks for running asynchronous functions concurrently.

- **4-tasks.py:** A program that shows how to use asyncio.gather() to run multiple asynchronous functions and gather their results.

# Compiling and Executing

You can run these Python programs using Python 3.7 or later. Follow these steps to execute the programs:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired program's directory, e.g., `0x01-python_async_function`:


  ```bash
  Navigate to the desired program's directory, e.g., 0x01-python_async_function:
  ```

3. Execute the program using Python:

   ```bash
   python3 <program_name>.py
   ```

Replace `<program_name>` with the name of the program you want to run.
