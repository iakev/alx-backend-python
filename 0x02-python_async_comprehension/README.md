# Introduction

Welcome to the `0x02-python_async_comprehension` repository! This repository contains Python programs and examples related to asynchronous comprehensions. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the programs included, instructions for compiling and executing them, and additional resources for further learning.

# Program Descriptions

1. **0-async_generator.py**
   - Description: Demonstrates the use of asynchronous comprehensions with a simple async generator function.
   - [Link to Program](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-python/blob/main/0x02-python_async_comprehension/0-async_generator.py)

2. **1-async_comprehension.py**
   - Description: Illustrates the concept of asynchronous comprehensions to fetch and return random numbers.
   - [Link to Program](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-python/blob/main/0x02-python_async_comprehension/1-async_comprehension.py)

3. **2-measure_runtime.py**
   - Description: Measures and compares the runtime of synchronous and asynchronous comprehensions.
   - [Link to Program](https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-python/blob/main/0x02-python_async_comprehension/2-measure_runtime.py)

# Compiling and Executing

To run any of the Python programs listed above, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iakev/alx-backend-python.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the `0x02-python_async_comprehension` directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-backend-python/0x02-python_async_comprehension
   ```

4. Execute the desired program using Python:

   ```bash
   python3 0-async_generator.py
   ```

Replace `0-async_generator.py` with the filename of the program you want to run.

# Resources

For further exploration and learning, consider these resources related to asynchronous comprehensions and Python generators:

- [**PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0530/)

  Dive into Python Enhancement Proposal 530 to get an in-depth understanding of asynchronous comprehensions and how they were introduced in Python.

- [**What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators**](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2017/02/14/whats-new-in-python-asynchronous-comprehensions-generators/)

  This section of the Python documentation highlights the introduction of asynchronous comprehensions and generators in Python.

- [**Type-hints for generators**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42531143/how-to-type-hint-a-generator-in-python-3)

  This section of PEP 484 discusses type hints for generators, which can be useful for maintaining type safety in your code when using asynchronous comprehensions.

These resources provide valuable insights and documentation on the topic, helping you dive deeper into asynchronous comprehensions and Python's capabilities.
